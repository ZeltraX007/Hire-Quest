The Placement Management System is a web application for the training and  placement department of our college. This system can be accessed throughout the  organization with proper login credentials. Students will be able to upload their  personal and educational information which will be managed efficiently by the  system. It intends to provide a fast access to the placement procedures and related  activities and ensures to maintain the details of the student secure. The key feature of  this project is that it is a onetime registration enabled system. This project will aid  colleges to practice full IT deployment.
